When you click on an individual series, it should display the first page of comics for that series in the Comics container and then allow for pagination across that collection if there's more than pageSize.
    * Take data out of .attr and put into .data - doing this should alleviate need to do intParse.
    * Need to add pagination for Comics once a series is selected.
