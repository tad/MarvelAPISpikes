When you click on an individual series, it should display the first page of comics for that series in the Comics
container and then allow for pagination across that collection if there's more than pageSize.

- Figure out how to handle series comics url (for right pane)

- Show title when mouse over

* Make boxes for comics larger on page load. When loading first page, show loading div.

* Organize functions in a more readable order

* Get Webstorm greenlight - address issues ws finds

- Need to add pagination for Comics once a series is selected.
