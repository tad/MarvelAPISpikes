Right now when comic is clicked in right hand pane, a large version of the comic appears which can be clicked
 again to remove. This needs to be replaced with a more informative version.

- Get comic click to work properly on pages after 1st page.

- When series is clicked, put loading Div over comics pane.

- Put Series and Comics divs into a div container. Float series left and comics right.

- When series comic (in right pane) is clicked, show larger cover image with info about selected comic
