MarvelAPISpikes
===============

Index.html - this is the primary page for this toy. Type in a Marvel character name and press the button. Series in
which the character appears will show up in the box below. 18 titles at a time will display. This display is paginated.

Eventually you'll be able to click on one of the series titles to then load the other box with comics in the series you
picked in which your character appears. Clicking on one of those comics will show information about it and possibly
allow you to open it on Marvel's website if you subscribe to Marvel Ultimate.

characterlist.html - click the button to see a list of all ~1400 characters that Marvel has in its database. You need
to use the character's name as it shows up in this list on the index.html page.

*This is toy code - there is no error handling. This is not representative of pretty and clean code*.

This is very much a work in progress.
Code may not be clean, properly refactored or even working. I check in code when I'm done working for the day and
there won't be a stable branch.

I'm just playing around with the Marvel API and hitting it with raw Javascript + jQuery.

Eventually I will use some of this code to make a nice, useful and pretty comics reading list application.
